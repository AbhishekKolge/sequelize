migration:
npm i --save-dev sequelize-cli

then inside project
npm i --save sequelize
npx sequelize-cli init

it will create a config, migration, model and seeder folders

config will have development, test and production mode. default will be development mode.

create migration (when we create migration, it will create a model and migration file)
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Users --attribute name:string,email:string

we can edit migration file to add or delete columns.

to migrate the model
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

once we migrate a file, it can not be migrate again unless we delete that migration entry from SequelizeMeta table.

undo last migration
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

undo all migration
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

undo specific migration
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo --name migrationFileName

migration status
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:status
